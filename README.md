I'm Alex, a software engineer based in the UK.

I like to design and build whatever projects pique my curiosity! I'm gonna start adding any new projects here on GitHub ^_^

Right now I'm working with Blazor, React, and .NET (✿◠‿◠)

I'm currently learning .NET MAUI and Rust ₘ(\\|)._.(|/)ₘ <-- (crab)
